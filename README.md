# Omarchy Zero Two Theme

Zero Two is a dark Omarchy theme inspired by the character from Darling in the FranXX, featuring vibrant pink/red accents, deep structural tones, and a near-black base. Rounded glass surfaces with luminous quality and flowing forms capture her energetic essence.

## What's Included

- Native Omarchy Quattro theming through `colors.toml`, `shell.toml`, and `hyprland.lua`, including shared pink/green border gradients, shell surfaces, controls, spacing, and typography.

- Current terminal and editor mappings for Alacritty, Foot, Ghostty, Kitty, Helix, Pi, VS Code, Zed, Warp, and Neovim.
- A standalone [Vencord theme](vencord.theme.css) with its own layered Discord treatment instead of a thin palette pass-through.

### Animated Wallpapers

The `backgrounds/` directory also includes six optimized 4K H.264 loops for setups that support animated wallpapers. Their original 3840×2160 resolution and frame rates are preserved.

Omarchy Quattro's built-in background picker currently selects static image formats only, so these videos are intentionally shipped as optional assets for an animated-wallpaper tool such as `mpvpaper`. They do not replace the static wallpapers or interfere with normal theme switching.

## Requirements

- Omarchy 4.0 (Quattro) for native shell and Hyprland Lua treatment
- `Yaru-magenta` icon theme
- Optional animated-wallpaper renderer for the bundled MP4 loops
